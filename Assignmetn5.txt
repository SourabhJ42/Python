# Assignment/Exercises 
# Topics covered : Modules,Functions,Looping,Conditional constructs,Input,Output,LIST Collections :
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 1) Create a program named "my_list_store"
# which support following operations on list named "members" which is provided by the user 
# for ex: ["Pratiksha","Kevin","Sachin","Yuvraj","Sania"] is provided by the user 
# Operations supported by our program are :
#   1:  Display number of elements in the members list
#   2:  Add an element to the members collection like 'Sehwag' 
#   3:  Add elements to the members collection like ['David','Bret','Sanju']
#   4:  Remove a member from the collection at a given subscript
#   5:  Remove the last member from the collection 
#   6:  Display third, fourth and fifth element from the collection 
# Keep asking the user for the operation in this store untill he chooses to exit from the program

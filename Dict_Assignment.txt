# 2) Create a program named "my_dict_store" which support following operations on
# dictionary named "capitals" which would have keys as their country and values as their capitals
# respectively from the user
# for ex: "India" : "New Delhi" ,"USA" : "Washington DC","Nepal": "Kathmandu","Ukraine" : "Kyiv"
# is provided by the user
#
# Operations supported by our program are :
#     1: Display number of elements in the capitals collection
#     2: Add an element to the capitals collection like --> Afghanistan: Kabul
#     3: Add multiple elements to the capitals collection like -->  Albania:Tirana,Algeria:Algiers,Andorra:Andorra la Vella
#     4: Remove an element from the collection
#
# Keep asking the user for the operation in this store untill he chooses to exit from the program

# 3)  Create a program named "my_set_store" which support following operations on two sets
#     provided by user
#
# for ex:
#  A = {1,2,3,4,5}
#  B = {18,19,20,21}
# is provided by the user
#
# Operations supported by our program are :
#  1: Union
#  2: Intersection
#  3: A-B
#  4: B-A
#  5: Take a element from user and Display if that element is a member of set B
#  6: Display number of elements in the set A
#     7: Display number of elements in the set B
#  8: Add an element taken from the user to the set A
#  9: Add multiple elements taken from the user to the set A
#  10: Remove an element taken from the user from set A
